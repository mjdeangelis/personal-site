      <p>
        I&apos;m a 31-year-old front-end engineer from Philadelphia with over 10
        years of professional experience. React is my specialty, and I find joy
        in taking on complex problems with a creative and inquisitive mindset.
        While I&apos;m not currently seeking work, I&apos;m always happy to
        connect and discuss potential opportunities.
